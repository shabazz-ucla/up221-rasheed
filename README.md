# profile
## Rasheed Shabazz is an urban planning doctoral student. His work focuses on race, space, and history. 

## Course description
GIS and Spatial Data Science exposes students to spatial data science.

## Project Ideas
I have short-term and long-term projects. For this quarter, I want to use this course to work with two datasets:
1. Mapping Mosques: In March, I will present at the AAG conference. I will focus on neighborhood change around mosques in 10 U.S. Cities.
2. Rent Registry: I have a Rent Registry Dataset for the City of Oakland, California. I'd like to join the dataset to the Alameda County Assessor data to map rents within the City.

3. Longer term, I want to use the Home Owners Loan Corporation data to map land use regulations embedded in Area Descriptions.

## Course Objectives
I started coding without a solid foundation in principles and grammar of the language of Python. I want to improve my coding skills, data management, and work alongside others doing data science. I want to use the class to complete my paper for AAG.
